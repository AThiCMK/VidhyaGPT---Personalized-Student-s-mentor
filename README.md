In India, education is a critical aspect of studentsâ€™ development, yet the approach to self-learning through online platforms raises concerns about the quality and efficiency of courses. Learning enthusiasts often find themselves spending days on online courses or months sifting through dense documentation.


      Are students learning what they actually need?
      Are they evaluated individually?
      Does everyone have the same learning curve?
      Is language a problem?


The challenge lies in:

1. Guiding them toward efficient learning

2. Ensuring practical understanding

3. Retention of knowledge

**Proposed Solution:**
